Based off https://github.com/MarcWeber/autohotkey_viper

Heavily modified, removed a lot of the bloat.

Features:
hjkl
gg
G
v highlight (doesn't work with $ or G due to Shift Down key issue w/ AHK)

x, number repeats (e.g. 5j)

Basic stuff, enough to make me enjoy using Evernote

Enabled / disabled via Caps Lock, only activates on Evernote

Todo: ":w" (requires adding state) and fix v highlight for $ and G
